In the kingdom of Arachnus, there were four unique races; the Red Racers, the Azure Allures, the Golden Grabbers, and the Brown Breaths. The four races lived in perfect harmony,
with one king or queen for every race. The kingdom's defense, the Geared Guardians, had only a few goals. 1: Defense of the Royal Four, 2: Defense of the kingdom, and 3: Defense
of the Potentpulse Web. The Potentpulse Web was a hidden, intricate web that ran through the kingdom, supplying it with power and holding the balance through rituals held by the
citizens of the kingdom. History books within the kingdom tell tales of the Voidweaver, a spiritual spider created with the purpose of destruction. The spider, obtaining too much
power, sent itself toward the Potentpulse, destroying the kingdom in his wake. As he arrived toward the central city, he was stopped by the Royal Four of the time, trapping him in
a sealed cavern deep beneath the surface. These four rulers became known as the legends of their time... the Apex Quadrivium. As these history books were spread throughout the
world, one man became interested in finding this hidden kingdom. Satoru Gojo, the best bounty hunter/detective of his time, hundreds of years after the Voidweaver, began his
search for Arachnus. After only four long months, he had found it, deep within the Katachougan Mountains
