Dear Journal,

It's escaped. The creature is gone. I find solace in the lack of darkness which once took over my soul and body. My arms and legs ache as I scribble down these nonsensical thoughts to the page. The ones which tested are dead. The void broke free of its cage and those which tortured it have been absorbed. It look me in the eyes as it took back what was its own as I screamed in agony.
