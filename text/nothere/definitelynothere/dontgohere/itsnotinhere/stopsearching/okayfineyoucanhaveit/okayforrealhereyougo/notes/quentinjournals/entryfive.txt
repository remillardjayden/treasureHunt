Dear Journal, 

I've escaped them. Those wretched hunters are gone. I find myself in a cave with nowhere else to go. The light at the end of the tunnel makes me fear for my life. I wish to escape it all, get away from the ones who harmed my home. I will train myself in these caves, and ruin the lives of any who come close. I will make it my duty. Our duty.
