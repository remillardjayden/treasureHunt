Dear Journal,

They think I'm lying. They tossed me in a cell and now here I lay awaiting my interrogation. I have been aching from head to toe in both a physical and mental manner. My soul is tainted, my mind and thoughts in agonizing pain. The void will consume our world and we cannot do a thing. The interrogation will happen soon and if I cannot convince them, I will be imprisoned and my world will be decimated.

We have finished the interrogation. They finally believed me. They did imprison me for sneaking into their homes, but I will gain freedom when they get the funds to get me a shop. I can finally live my life properly once again. No more capturing, no more cells, no more torture, just peace.
