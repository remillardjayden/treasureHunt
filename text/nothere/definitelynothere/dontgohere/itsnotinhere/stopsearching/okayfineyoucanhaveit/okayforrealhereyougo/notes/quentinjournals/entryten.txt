Dear Journal,

It's been about 40 years, and I grow more concerned about my own physical state. I have not aged one bit. My physical self has not changed since I fully encountered the Voidweaver. I still shudder as I write his name. He has since been... let's say "imprisoned". I can't help but feel as though part of me is lost after my encounter. I think he has overtaken my soul, slowly infecting my body and reverting any aging that occurs. This feeling crushes me at times, making me feel irrelevant. Nonetheless, I still run my shop daily for the citizens.

Q
