The day has finally arrived. Power flows through me as I find myself hiding who I am from all. The tendrils spike as I scream in agony and others try to come in. He's escaped once again and the Apex Quadrivinium are not here to stop him. The castle is gone and I find myself aching. I crumble to the floor as I crawl my way to one of the many breaks within the Earth. I fall in, accepting my fate, when I find myself suddenly in control of the Void. It seems that he remained within my soul after the experiments occurred. Now that I've grown more powerful, I shall take back what was mine. Those hunters and many more will know what happens when you mess with Quentin Quagmire.
